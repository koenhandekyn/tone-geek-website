    title1: "A COSY ATMOSPHERE"
    title2: "WITH PERSONAL ATTENTION"
    p1: "VEJERÍSIMO is a Guest House situated in a quiet little street in the heart of the historic center of Vejer de la Frontera. The restaurants, typical bars and places of interest are just a footstep away. Next to the house you will find the old city wall with “La Puerta Cerrada” (Closed Door), one of the 4 old entrances to the village."
    p2: "The centuries-old house has been restored maintaining Moorish features but with a 21th century twist. The house has 4 double rooms situated around a typical patio. It has a lot of cozy corners: read a book next to the patio’s library or enjoy the roof terrace with its long chairs and chill-out corners. We promise you an unforgettable stay!"

    intro_a: "The Tone-Geek pedals are more than 'just' great sounding pedals. They enable you to store and recall 'analog presets', but when put together they act as one combined pedal." 
    intro_b: "Analog sound, wireless convenience!"
    core:
      subtitle: "Boost Overdrive Distortion"
      p1: "This pedal is what got Tone-Geek started. Two effects combined into one pedal providing the solid foundation for your guitar sound."
      p2: "The first effect is essentially a boost effect. Cranking up the volume will drive your tube amp into that sweet overdrive region that we all love. When used at low volume settings, the drive control can be set to give a mild edge to your tone, all the way to a thick overdrive sound."
      p3: "The second effect is an overdrive/distortion effect. The gain settng brings you from mild overdrive to a high gain overdrive sound. When the boost button is kicked in the gain is increased further and a distortion sound is created. At full gain with your guitar set to the neck pickup, you even get a fuzz-like tone!"
      p4: "Both effects can be kicked in independently, like it were 2 separate pedals. The effect order is fixed."
      p5: "Like all Tone-geek pedals, Core provides 4 presets, allowing you to create 4 independent drive sounds, store them and recall them when you perform!"
    legacy:
      subtitle: "Loop in your favorite effects"
      p1: "At Tone-Geek we believe that creating a great sound means including some of the mindblowing vintage (or why not new) pedals. So we developed a loop pedal that can be integrated in your Tone-geek setup."
      p2: "Legacy provides two loops allowing you to loop in any pedal you like. The pedal provides 4 presets."
      p3: "The genuine beauty of the pedal comes when you conbine it with other Tone-Geek pedals, like the Core. In this combination the Tone-Geek pedals will act as one, meaning that the presets you store will not only store the local settings of the pedal, but also the settings of the other Tone-Geek pedals in your rig. Recalling your preset also restores the settings on the other pedals. It is truely like the pedals are unified. Simple and intuitive!"
